# MulticameraTraking
That's my bachelor thesis in coputer engeneering. It reconstructs 3d position of objects viewed by more than one camera. Object detection is implemented with a simple hsv color based method and 3d point estimation with a least square method.
It's all documented on the [thesis.pdf](https://github.com/MarioBonse/multicamera3DMotionReconstruction/blob/master/thesis.pdf) file.
### Result
Some result can be seen on this animations.
The first one is the ball bounce.
#### First
This is the video captured by one of the two cameras and his reconstruction:<br/>

#### Second
This is me triing to test better the depth:<br/>
